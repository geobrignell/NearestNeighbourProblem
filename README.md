# NearestNeighbourProblem
Using multi core programming to solve and optimise the problem in computational geometry of identifying the point from a set of points which is nearest to a given point according to some measure of distance.

Methods to perform the Number of Nearest Atom Neighbours using various strategies such as brute force and cell list.

Programmed in C++ and making use of parallel programming using MPI for a couple of the methods.
